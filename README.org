*Twine* is a very thin wrapper around threads stuff. For now, it only wraps SDL's threads (but maybe I'll expand it to include pthreads and/or C11's threads).

Besides that, it provides a few simple init functions with error handling baked in.

It does not have a implementation part, the entire thing is in the header (the functions are inline).

It depends on *guard*, another one of my libs, so you have to include that. You also have to include SDL stuff (in case your paths are different or something). Like this:

#+begin_src C 

#include "../path/to/guard.h"
#include <SDL3/SDL_atomic.h>
#include <SDL3/SDL_mutex.h>

#include "twine.h"

#+end_src

A real readme is forthcoming.
